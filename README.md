This Harry Potter themed RESTful API application invites the user to create an account (or by logging in) and will then be directed to a Hogwarts-specific quiz that sorts the user into one of the four houses based on their answers: Gryffindor,Ravenclaw,Slytherin,Hufflepuff. Each of these houses renders a tailored playlist via Spotify Api! The contributors of this project used the MVC paradigm to structure this project.
